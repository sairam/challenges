ALPHABET SOUP

Alfredo Spaghetti really likes soup, especially when it contains alphabet 
pasta. Every day he constructs a sentence from letters, places the letters into 
a bowl of broth and enjoys delicious alphabet soup.

Today, after constructing the sentence, Alfredo remembered that the Facebook 
Hacker Cup starts today! Thus, he decided to construct the phrase "HACKERCUP". 
As he already added the letters to the broth, he is stuck with the letters he 
originally selected. Help Alfredo determine how many times he can place the 
word "HACKERCUP" side-by-side using the letters in his soup.


INPUT

The first line of the input file contains a single integer T: the number of 
test cases. T lines follow, each representing a single test case with a 
sequence of upper-case letters and spaces: the original sentence Alfredo 
constructed.


OUTPUT

Output T lines, one for each test case. For each case, output "Case #t: n", 
where t is the test case number (starting from 1) and n is the number of times 
the word "HACKERCUP" can be placed side-by-side using the letters from the 
sentence.


CONSTRAINTS

    1 < T â‰¤ 20
    Sentences contain only the upper-case letters A-Z and the space character
    Each sentence contains at least one letter, and contains at most 1000 
characters, including spaces
